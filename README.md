# Graph Path Counter â€“ Count Paths Ending at Each Node in a DAG

##  Description

This program processes a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** and computes, for each node, the number of distinct paths that end at it.

In particular, it:

1. Prints all valid paths in the given DAG that end at node `D` (index 3).
2. Computes, using a **topological sort and dynamic programming**, the number of paths ending at **every** node.

---

### Question 1

> List all paths in the DAG that end at node `D`.

**Answer:**
- A â†’ B â†’ D  
- A â†’ C â†’ D  
- B â†’ C â†’ D  
- B â†’ D  
- C â†’ D  
- D (length 0 path)


The program implements the following:

- Topological sorting 
- For each node `v`, the number of paths ending at `v` is computed by:
  - `dp[v] = dp[v] + dp[u]` for every edge `u â†’ v`
- Initialization: each node starts with `dp[v] = 1` (the path consisting of itself)

---

##  Correctness Justification

- The algorithm traverses the DAG in topological order.
- For each node `v`, every path ending at its predecessors contributes new paths to `v`.
- Ensures no cycles and every `dp[v]` is computed **after** all `dp[u]` for predecessors `u`.

---

##  Time Complexity

- **Topological Sort:** O(|V| + |E|)
- **Path Count Update:** O(|E|) (each edge visited once)
- **Total Runtime:** **O(|V| + |E|)**

```
        //0->A
        //1->B
        //2->C
        //3->D
        graph.get(0).add(1);
        graph.get(1).add(3);
        graph.get(1).add(2);
        graph.get(2).add(3);
```

##  Example Output
```
Number of paths ending at each node:
A: 1
B: 2
C: 3
D: 6
```

# Question 2

# Even Red Cells Coloring â€“ Dynamic Programming Solution

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Description

Given an array of size `n`, each cell can be colored in one of three colors: **Red**, **Blue**, or **Green**.  
The task is to count how many different ways we can color the array such that the number of **Red-colored** cells is **even**.
